# Ant Farm

Visualise the movement of ants in an ant farm.

This is minimum cost maximum flow problem

## Overview
- Generate random graph which represents an ant farm
- Select desired number of ants to walk across this ant farm
- Observe how ants walk through fastest paths from start node to end node 

## Implementation
- Algorithm for generating random edges: Steger-Wormald
- Algorithm for setting start and end nodes: bfs
- Algorithm for generating random positions: Fruchterman-Reingold
- Algorithm for finding fastest paths: Suurballe + Dijkstra
